# LDA-PCA_on_Thyroid_Data

1) The recorded 10 test values of KNN and LDA in two vectors are:

The k value of 3 is found to be the best estimator while tuning the parameters of the KNN model by 5-fold cross validation.  

2) The plot below shows two boxplots of AUC values of LDA and KNN respectively.

From the boxplots shown above we can conclude that the KNN model is a better fit for the newthyroid.txt data because it has higher median AUC values when compared to the linear discriminant analysis (LDA)model
